## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ routes/
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## Add Integrations and deployment

Use the `npm run qwik add` command to add additional integrations. Some examples of integrations include: Cloudflare, Netlify or Express server, and the [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/guides/static-site-generation/).

```shell
npm run qwik add # or `yarn qwik add`
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). During development, the `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output.

```shell
npm start # or `yarn start`
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, and it should not be used as a production server.

```shell
npm run preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build # or `yarn build`
```

## Express Server

This app has a minimal [Express server](https://expressjs.com/) implementation. After running a full build, you can preview the build using the command:

```shell
npm run serve
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Docker

To build your Docker image, you can use the --build-arg option to pass your environment variables:

```shell
docker build --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url> --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key> --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=<your_supabase_secret_key> -t <name-of-your-image>:<version> .
```

To create a image

```shell
docker run -d --name <name-of-your-container> -p 3000:3000 <name-of-your-image>:<version>
```
